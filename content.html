Your Return and Refund Policy should include important details about when you accept returns, what the conditions of return are, and how you issue refunds.
Remember that people are not inclined to read lengthy and boring legal documents online. However, it is vital to give all necessary information.
It's a good idea to divide your Return and Refund Policy into smaller parts. This will make the document easier to read, help customers find what they need, and protect you legally.
When considering what to put in your Return and Refund Policy, think about the fact that there are many advantages to ensuring it is customer-centric. Innovative businesses know that a customer-centric return program is an effective marketing tool. 
</p>
          <h2> Refund Policy Details</h2>
<p style="color: rgb(255,0,255);">
Before we get into what you should include in your Return & Refund Policy, here's a general rule to keep in mind:
Write the same way that you speak (normal, flowing language and not legalese)
If you're not a lawyer, don't pretend to be one
Even if you hire a lawyer, speak with that individual and get them to legally binding language that customers understand and give your Return and Refund Policy a personality
Your Return and Refund Policy should be good to go as long as you ensure the writing is clear, concise, and not open to interpretation.
Letting your customers know precisely how long they have to return a product is a crucial element to include in your Return and Refund Policy. Typically, ecommerce stores offer a 15- to 30-day window in which customers can return a product and ask for a refund. Some businesses extend that period up to 90 days.
